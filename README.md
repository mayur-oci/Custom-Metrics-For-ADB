# Oracle Cloud Custom Metrics with Oracle Autonomous Database
## Introduction
[Oracle Autonomous Database](https://www.oracle.com/autonomous-database/)(ADB) is revolutionizing how data is managed with the introduction of the worldâ€™s first "self-driving" database. ADB is powering critical business applications of enterprises, all over the world, as their primary data source. 

ADB provides many important database related [service metrics](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Database/References/databasemetrics_topic-Overview_of_the_Database_Service_Autonomous_Database_Metrics.htm) out of the box, thanks to its deep integration with OCI Monitoring Service. 
But many our innovative customers wish to take their Observability journey a step further:
These **customers want to collect, publish and analyse their own metrics, related to the application data stored in the ADB**. In Oracle Monitoring Service terminology we call these [*custom metrics*](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Tasks/publishingcustommetrics.htm). 

Custom metrics metrics are first class citizens of Oracle Cloud Monitoring Service, on par with native metrics. You can analyse them with the same powerfull MQL and setup Alarms on them to notify you whenever any event of interest or trouble happen.

In this tutorial, I will showcase how easily we can publish custom metrics from your ADB service, with just a few lines of PL/SQL script and few clicks on OCI Console!

## Prerequisites 
### Infrastructure
 1. Oracle cloud free tier account (needless to say paid accounts will work too)
 2. You can use any type of Oracle Autonomous Database Instance i.e.; shared or dedicated. For the tutorial though, Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing(ATP) instance with just 1 OCPU and 1 TB of storage, is sufficient. 
 
 ### Software Tools
 1. Basic PL/SQL familiarity.
 2. OCI Console familiarity.
 3. If you are going to use SQL Developer or Other desktop clients, then you also need to know about [how to connect to ADB using Wallet](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/cswgs/autonomous-connect-sql-developer.html#GUID-14217939-3E8F-4782-BFF2-021199A908FD).  In the tutorial we are going to use, we are going to use [SQL Developer Web](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/adbsa/sql-developer-web.html#GUID-C32A78E5-4C5F-476F-86AB-AEEEA9CF2704), available right from OCI Console page for ATP. 
 4. ADMIN user access to your ADB/ATP instance, incase you want to run the scripts of the tutorial, in new different DB schema other than the ADMIN. If you already have dedicated seperate schema, this requirenment can be skipped.
